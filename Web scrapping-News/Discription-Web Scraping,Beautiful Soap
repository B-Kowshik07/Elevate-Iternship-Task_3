🕸️ What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves sending a request to a webpage, retrieving the HTML content, and parsing it to extract useful information (like headlines, product prices, links, etc.).

📌 Common Uses of Web Scraping:
Collecting news headlines
Price tracking from e-commerce websites
Extracting job listings
Gathering stock/crypto prices
Monitoring website changes


🌿 What is BeautifulSoup?
BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It's one of the most popular tools for web scraping, especially when combined with requests.

It allows you to:
Search for tags (<h1>, <a>, etc.)
Extract text, links, or attribute values
Navigate HTML structures like parent/child/sibling nodes
Clean and structure the data easily

🔧 How it Works (Simplified):
Use requests to fetch the HTML of a webpage
Use BeautifulSoup to parse and search through the HTML
Extract and clean the required content

✅ Advantages of BeautifulSoup:
Easy to learn and use
Supports multiple parsers (html.parser, lxml, etc.)
Flexible for both simple and complex scraping tasks
Works well with requests (for most static sites)

⚠️ Note:
BeautifulSoup works best on static HTML content. For JavaScript-heavy websites, you’ll need tools like Selenium or Playwright.
